# Foodure_Android_App

**## Description :**

This is the official repository of the industrial training project of 2020-2021 done under Android App Development. In this training, I have made an android application named _**"FOODURE"**_, which is a **food delivery application** made using _Kotlin and XML_.

**## Problem Statement :**

Build a food ordering app that lists the restaurants and
their menu items. Using that app, the users can order
food items.
Further, the users can also save the restaurants as
favourites and view their order history. The app will
be built using XML and Kotlin.

**## Introduction :**

The Online Ordering System proposed here greatly simplifies
the ordering process for both the customer and the restaurant.
This system presents an interactive and up-to-date menu with
all available options in an easy to use manner. Customer can
choose one or more items, place the order which will land in
the cart. At the end, customer gets order confirmation details.
Once the order is placed it is entered in the database and can
be seen in the orders history in pretty much real time.

**## Summary of the Training Work :**

In this training, I have learnt about android and its features. I have learnt how to build an android application for any purpose. I have done the training for 6 weeks and gathered my knowledge by learning following modules : Introduction to Android, World of Kotlin, Android Kick-Off, Higher Order Functionalities and The Final Project module. In the Final Project module, I have applied my theoretical knowledge to practical implementation by making an online food delivery android application â€“ Foodure. I have also passed a final test in this training with 95% marks to get my training certificate.
I have learnt about Android App Development technology using Kotlin and XML languages and have prepared my project on software named Android Studio. I have completed my project using Volley Library, Room Persistence Library, Design Support Library, SQLite Database, JSON Objects, data classes, etc. I have learnt a lot of valuable information about Android and its Scope in the IT Sector. This training has given me both theoretical and practical knowledge with brilliant hands-on projects.
